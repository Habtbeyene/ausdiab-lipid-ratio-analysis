This repository contains R code for univariate lipid association analysis
and comprehensive directional lipid ratio analysis using data from the
Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study.

The pipeline performs:
- Covariate-adjusted univariate lipid association analysis
- Full directional lipid ratio analysis
- Global multiple-testing correction
- Identification of significant lipid ratios with gain in statistical power

The workflow is designed for high-dimensional lipidomics data and supports
parallel computation.
